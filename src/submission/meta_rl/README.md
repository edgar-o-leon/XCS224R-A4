## Using Meta_RL Environment

## Run the Code

To run the DREAM code, invoke the following command from the submission directory:

```
python -m meta_rl.scripts.exp_name exp_name -b environment=\"map\"
```

This will create a directory `experiments/exp_name`, which will contain:

- A tensorboard subdirectory at `experiments/exp_name/tensorboard`, which logs
  statistics, such as accumulated returns vs. number of training episodes, and
  also vs. number of training steps.
- A visualization subdirectory at `experiments/exp_name/visualize`, which will
  contain videos of the learned agent.
- A checkpoints subdirectory at `experiments/exp_name/checkpoints`, which will
  periodically save model checkpoints.
- Metadata about the run, such as the configs used.

You can pass different values for `exp_name` as convenient.
